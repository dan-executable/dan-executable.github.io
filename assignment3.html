  <h2>Visualization 1: Global Sales by Genre and Platform</h2>

  <p>
    <b>Reflection: </b>When looking at total global sales by genre and platform, what stood out most was how concentrated success is within a few genres, especially Action and Sports, which clearly outperform others. It’s interesting to see that sales aren’t evenly spread across platforms either; instead, a small number of consoles account for a large portion of the top-selling games. This suggests that both genre popularity and platform success play a big role in shaping overall performance. Rather than every genre thriving equally on every platform, the data shows certain pairings dominate, which likely reflects audience preferences, platform branding, and exclusive titles.

  <h2>Visualization 2: Global Sales Over Time by Platform</h2>
  <img src="images/visualization 2.png" alt="Sales Over Time by Platform" width="800">
  <p>
    <b>Reflection: </b>The sales trends over time reveal how closely the industry follows console life cycles. You can see clear rises and declines that align with the release and eventual fading of specific platforms, which makes the market feel very generational. While platforms come and go, major genres seem to remain consistently present, suggesting that player preferences don’t shift as dramatically as hardware does. Overall, this visualization makes it clear that industry growth is tied more to platform waves than sudden changes in genre demand, highlighting how hardware innovation drives much of the market’s momentum.

  <h2>Visualization 3: Regional Sales by Platform</h2>
  <img src="images/visualization 3.png" alt="Regional Sales by Platform" width="800">
  <p>
    <b>Reflection: </b>Comparing regional sales by platform makes it obvious that the global market isn’t uniform. North America and Europe show fairly similar patterns in terms of which platforms dominate, but Japan stands out with noticeably different preferences. Some platforms perform strongly in Western markets while showing weaker results in Japan, which likely reflects cultural differences and local brand loyalty. It’s also clear that North America and Europe contribute a larger share of total sales overall, reinforcing how influential those markets are in shaping global trends.

  <h2>Visualization 4: Visual Story</h2>
  <img src="images/visualization 4.png" alt="Visual Story" width="800">
  <p>
    <b>Reflection: </b>Focusing on regional sales trends over time highlights how different parts of the world contribute to the industry in distinct ways. North America and Europe tend to peak around similar periods, suggesting shared market cycles, while Japan follows a slightly different pattern in both scale and timing. This makes the overall story less about a single global trend and more about overlapping regional dynamics. What I found most interesting is how global performance appears to be driven primarily by a few dominant markets, rather than evenly across all regions.
